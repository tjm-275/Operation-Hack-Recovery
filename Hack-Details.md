# Hack Details

## How it happened:
(All information herein was disclosed after the hack had occurred)

Clients initially reported that one of their phones (iPhone) had been "acting weird and was randomly calling people."  This was in exceedance of a random 'butt-dial' scenario, as calls were somtimes made when the phone was stationary or in a purse.

iPhone taken to Apple store where nothing was found to be suspicious.

Phone call was received by clients from Amazon Fraud Department stating that there was suspicious activity on the account in the amount of $1500 for purchase of a new phone.

Client confirmed, over the phone, account information with the "Fraud Department." 

Clients received calls from their banks stating that there were numerous withdrawal attempts that had been flagged by their fraud alerts.  Approximate total of all attempted withdrawals - $10k.

All accounts were frozen by banks and case was handed over to the fraud department of each bank.  Clients were given confirmation that Social Security direct deposits would be unaffected and auto withdrawals for monthly bills would still be processed.

From the information gathered, it is likely that the attack was a classic email phishing scam combined with social engineering / vishing.

Client reported that she didn't click on any unknown email that she knew of, but the totality of the circumstances suggest that was how the attack began.

# Attack Details
- Likely began as an email phishing attack (a link was probably clicked)
- Escalation of attack into Vishing (Posed as Fraud Department at Amazon.com)
- Unknown how hackers found client's phone number (confirmed by client through email link?  found on a data scrape?)
- "Alerted" client of suspicious activity with her account in the amount of approximately $1,500 for a new phone
- Client verbally confirmed bank account information with hackers (told her they would put the money back in her account)
- Once account info was gained, attempted withdrawals began

# Hack Discovery
- Clients received actual fraud alerts from both banks regarding suspicious withdrawals
- Research by bank fraud depts showed hack was deeper than expected
- Only info for one bank account in one bank was given, hackers found a way into another account at a separate bank

# Summary
- Hack possibly began with the odd iPhone behavior (random calling others)
- Email phishing with escalation into Vishing, posed as Amazon Fraud Dept
- Account information given, attack ensued
- Bank Fraud Depts alerted of the hack
